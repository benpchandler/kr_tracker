# Project Status

Date: September 22, 2025

- Extracted cascade deletion logic into `src/services/deletionService.ts` with full type definitions and helpers.
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to consume the new service while keeping UI state and handlers intact.
- Added comprehensive unit coverage in `src/services/deletionService.test.ts`; `npm run test:unit` passes.
- No additional regressions observed; UI components still route deletions through the shared service API.

### Session: Metrics + ISO Week Testing Hardening
- Added `summarizeMetrics` helper and re-exported internal calculators in `src/metrics/engine.ts:1-381` to enable direct testing.
- Introduced ISO week utilities in `src/utils/weeks.ts:1-71` (UTC-stable parsing, capped `generateWeeks`) and corresponding suites in `src/utils/weeks.test.ts:1-111`.
- Authored table-driven and property-based tests in `src/metrics/engine.test.ts:1-480` covering health thresholds, aggregation pace/forecast logic, rolling windows, and finiteness invariants.
- Installed fast-check support already present in dev deps; `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:coverage` now pass with engine at ~90% coverage and weeks utilities at 100%.

## UI Improvements Session

### Card Deletion Animations
- Added smooth slide-out animations when cards are deleted
- Created CSS animations in `src/styles/globals.css` with `.kr-cards-grid` and `.kr-card-item` classes
- Updated `App.tsx` to manage `removingCards` state and apply animation before actual deletion
- 300ms animation duration for smooth visual feedback when removing KRs or Initiatives

### View All Modal Implementation
- Created `ViewAllModal` component for displaying full lists of Objectives, KRs, and Initiatives
- Added modal state management (`viewAllModalOpen`, `viewAllModalType`) to `App.tsx`
- Connected "View all X →" links to open modals instead of expanding sections
- Modal features: scrollable list, edit/delete actions, add button, item counts

### UI Consistency Updates
- Added "View all" links to organization structure cards (Teams, Pods, People, Functions)
- Ensured consistent behavior: links only appear when > 3 items exist
- All "View all" links now use the same styling and interaction pattern
- Organization cards use existing `AllEntitiesView` modal, Objectives/KRs/Initiatives use new `ViewAllModal`

### Missing Features Restored
- Added "Add Objective" button to Objectives card (placeholder implementation)
- Restored visual consistency across all Plan Mode cards
- All cards now have both "Add" buttons and conditional "View all" links

## Session: E2E test timeout fix (planning-org-entities-db)
- Investigated Playwright failure: 10s timeout on page.waitForResponse and later on clicking pod team select trigger.
- Moved waitForResponse for POST /api/pod to immediately before submitting the Add Pod form.
- Hardened Radix Select interactions: ensured trigger visibility, used force click to bypass animation/overlay, and selected option from page root due to portal rendering.
- Increased /api/pod waitForResponse timeout to 30s to reduce flakiness.
- Committed changes to tests/e2e/planning-org-entities-db.spec.ts with message: "e2e: fix org entities persistence flake by hardening Radix Select interaction and moving waitForResponse closer to submit; extend /api/pod wait timeout".
- Verified git identity remains personal (benpchandler@gmail.com).

## Session: React Ref Forwarding Fix

### Issue Identified
- Console warning: "Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail."
- Error originated from `Input` component at `src/components/ui/input.tsx:3:27`
- Component was using function syntax without `React.forwardRef`

### Solution Applied
- Converted `Input` component from function declaration to `React.forwardRef`
- Added proper ref forwarding to the underlying `<input>` element
- Added `displayName` property for better debugging experience
- Fixed TypeScript types to properly handle `HTMLInputElement` ref

### Code Changes
- Updated `/src/components/ui/input.tsx` to use:
  ```tsx
  const Input = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, React.ComponentProps<"input">>(
    ({ className, type, ...props }, ref) => {
      return <input ref={ref} ... />
    }
  )
  Input.displayName = "Input"
  ```

### Prompt Engineering
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting prompt for fixing ref forwarding errors
- Prompt includes: error explanation, transformation patterns, component checklist, and verification steps
- Can be reused for fixing similar issues in other UI components (Button, Textarea, Select, etc.)

### Result
- Input component now properly forwards refs to DOM element
- Compatible with form libraries (React Hook Form) and focus management
- Console warning resolved

## Session: React ForwardRef Implementation Validation

### Task: Validate LLM's comprehensive forwardRef implementation claims
- LLM reported updating 35+ UI components with React.forwardRef and display names
- Claimed fixes across form controls, structural widgets, overlays, menus, and utility components

### Validation Process
- Systematically checked all component categories mentioned in LLM's report
- Used grep to identify forwardRef usage across src/components/ui/
- Verified display name assignments for React DevTools compatibility
- Ran ESLint to ensure no code quality issues

### Verified Components
- **Core form controls** (✅ Confirmed):
  - Input.tsx: forwardRef at line 5, displayName at line 25
  - Textarea.tsx: forwardRef at line 5, displayName at line 22
  - Checkbox.tsx: forwardRef at line 9, displayName at line 33
  - RadioGroup.tsx: forwardRef at lines 9 & 25, displayNames set
  - Label, Slider confirmed via grep

- **Structural widgets** (✅ Confirmed):
  - Card.tsx: All 7 components use forwardRef (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, etc.)
  - Accordion.tsx: 4 components with forwardRef
  - Table.tsx: 8 components with forwardRef (Table, TableHeader, TableBody, etc.)

- **Interactive overlays** (✅ Confirmed):
  - Dialog.tsx: 8 components with forwardRef and displayNames
  - AlertDialog.tsx: 10 components with forwardRef and displayNames
  - Drawer, Sheet, Popover, Tooltip confirmed via grep

### Results
- **All assertions verified as accurate** - 35 files use React.forwardRef
- All components properly set displayName for debugging
- ESLint passes with no warnings
- Implementation ensures full compatibility with form libraries and focus management systems

## Manager Autocomplete Improvements Session

Date: September 22, 2025

### Fixed Manager Search Logic
- Resolved overly broad matching that caused incorrect suggestions (e.g., "David Wilson" appearing when searching for "Marcus")
- Implemented word-based filtering that only matches when query words match the start of words in person fields
- Search now properly filters on name, function, and team fields using word boundaries

### Quick Manager Creation Feature
- Added ability to create managers on-the-fly directly from the autocomplete dropdown
- Shows "Add '[name]' as new manager" button when no matches are found
- Auto-generates email address and creates minimal profile for quick managers
- Displays confirmation message after successful manager selection

### Enhanced Autocomplete UX
- Implemented minimal mode for cleaner, less intrusive interface
- Dropdown only appears when actively typing (not on focus)
- Properly closes after selection
- Tab key accepts first suggestion for faster workflow

### Testing Results
- ✅ Manager search correctly filters using word-start matching
- ✅ Quick manager creation successfully adds new managers
- ✅ Form properly saves and doesn't clear unexpectedly
- ✅ Successfully added both quick manager and new person in testing

### Files Modified
- `src/components/OrganizationManagerFixed.tsx` - New component with fixed manager search logic
- `src/components/AutocompleteInput.tsx` - Enhanced with minimal mode and better dropdown behavior
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated to use OrganizationManagerFixed component

### Commit
- 3ff2f81 - "fix: Improve manager autocomplete search and quick creation"

## Session: Org Entity Persistence Wiring
- Implemented persistent API routes for teams, pods, and functions in `server/index.cjs`, including schema migrations, row mappers, and JSON responses that mirror the frontend types.
- Updated `src/utils/dataAdapter.ts` and `src/components/OrganizationManagerFixed.tsx` so all Add dialogs (team, pod, function, person) call the backend before mutating local state, with graceful fallbacks when the server is disabled.
- Added Playwright coverage: `tests/e2e/planning-person-db.spec.ts` (passes) verifies Planning→Add Person writes to SQLite; `tests/e2e/planning-org-entities-db.spec.ts` (currently failing at pod team select interaction) plus shared `tests/e2e/utils/sqlite.ts` helpers for DB assertions.
- Introduced small accessibility tweaks (`data-testid="pod-team-trigger"`) to help automate the Radix Select control; further refinement needed to unblock the pod-selection step.
- Next steps: finish stabilizing the org-entities E2E test, then expand to update/edit flows once create paths are green.
